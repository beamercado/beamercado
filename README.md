<h1 align="center">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p align="left">
    Iâ€™m Bea, a computer science student at the University of the Philippines Los BaÃ±os with a background on web development, particularly in backend programming. I have more experience working on server-side components, but Iâ€™m also committed to improving my frontend skills to become a more versatile developer.

<h3 align="left">Projects</h3>
<p align="left">
    Most of my current projects stem from my academic work, where Iâ€™ve developed web applications focusing on backend development. Outside of class, Iâ€™ve worked on automating simple tasks to help streamline processes for certain jobs. While Iâ€™m still building my portfolio, Iâ€™m eager to start new projects and develop practical web solutions.
